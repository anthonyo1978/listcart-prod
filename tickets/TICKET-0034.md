## Goal
Verify and reinforce the current animation behavior so that the cat walks across the screen only once per page load, and does not repeat unless the page is reloaded.

## Requirements
- Review the existing animation code controlling the cat walk.
- Fix any issues causing the animation to repeat more than once.
- Test thoroughly across browsers and devices to confirm correct behavior.
- Add logging or comments to clarify the animation control logic.
- Update or document the code for maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The animated cat walks across only once per page load.
- [ ] No unintended repeats or loops occur.
- [ ] Tests are done on desktop and mobile browsers.
- [ ] Code is clear, maintainable and documented.
