Task:

I wish that the landing page had a different hero header...

Can you possible change the text to "Automate and monetise the listing process"

Also, perhaps certain letters could flip over to reveal this message, a bit like the airport how destinations flip up and down.

The general idea is that the flipping and unvealing message draws your eye on arrival to the page.

This only happens on first load or refresh, this sits there beautifully!


Feel free to vibe on that.
